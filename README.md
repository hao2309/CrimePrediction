In geostatistics, Cokriging is a multivariate variant of Kriging technique and makes spatial predictions for a sparsely sampled variable (the primary variable) of interest, with help of one or more well-sampled ancillary variables (the secondary co-variables). Cokriging method usually results in more accurate predictions of the target primary variable than Kriging. This is because Cokriging method exploits cross-correlations between the primary variable and the secondary co-variables in addition to the spatial autocorrelation of the primary variable.
In conventional Cokriging method, both the primary variable and co-variables are in spatial domain, and time dimension is not taken into consideration. By extending it from sole spatial domain to the spatio-temporal domain, this algorithm formulated a ST-Cokriging method that is capable of taking advantage of both spatial and temporal correlation within and between primary and co-variables to produce temporally frequent predictions for the primary variable at a high spatial resolution as the co-variables.
